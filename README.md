# Covid-19 Statistic Dashboard

This development challenge was created by myself and makes use of a Covid-19 API here: https://rapidapi.com/Gramzivi/api/covid-19-data

### The Challenge

The task was to integrate a Covid-19 API to pull various statistics, and manipulate the data to display an easy to read dashboard.

### What it does

You should be able to:

- See a breakdown of the global statistics from daily and all time perspectives
- View a bar chart of global statistics from daily and all time perspectives
- View the top 5 infected countries and breakdown of stats
- Search for a specific Country
- View breakdown of a specific country on a separate page, including stats overview and bar chart

# Hosted site

Project was written using Vue.js framework, including icons taken from https://fontawesome.com/ and covid-19 API pulled using Axios (https://github.com/axios/axios). Bar charts were also created using Chart.js (https://www.chartjs.org/)
Finally, the project was deployed to Netlify here: https://covid-stats-dashboard.netlify.app/#/
